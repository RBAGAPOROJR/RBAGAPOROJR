## Hi, I’m Ronald 👋
## I've been working in IT technical support for almost 8 years now. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of assisting users with a wide range of technical issues, from troubleshooting software problems to resolving network issues. While my expertise lies primarily in traditional IT support, I'm also currently a student pursuing a degree in Mobile Application Development. Although I'm relatively new to this field, I'm incredibly passionate about mobile technology and excited to expand my skills in this area. I believe that my experience in IT support, coupled with my enthusiasm for mobile app development, will enable me to contribute effectively to any project or team.
